Introduction
============

This is the documentation for integration of Paylot inline javascript
client.

**NB:** Before you can start integrating Paylot, you will need a Paylot
account. Create a free account now if you havenâ€™t already done so:
https://beta.paylot.co/signup.

After that, you can proceed to add a merchant/business at
https://beta.paylot.co/businesses/create

Once you have added your business details, you would be required to add
at least one payment processor to accept payments. This involves adding
a currency you would be collecting (**BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH**) and what you
prefer to store it as (For now, Naira).

Once you are done. You are good to go.
